Deep Learning Teaching Kit Labs

## System Requirements

#### NVIDIA CUDA/GPUs

Thanks to the rapid development of modern GPUs, training deep networks in a large-scale, data-driven context becomes more and more affordable in terms of both time and resource cost.
Training neural networks on [NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) is practically a necessity for the Deep Learning Teaching Kit labs, including both convolutional networks (Lab1 and Lab2) and recurrent networks (in Lab4).

The use of GPUs for the Teaching Kit labs requires a CUDA supported operating system, C compiler, and a recent CUDA Toolkit. The CUDA Toolkit can be downloaded
from the [CUDA Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) page. Instructions on how to install the CUDA Toolkit are available in the
[Quick Start page](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/index.html). Installation guides and the list of supported C compilers for [Windows](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html), [Linux](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html), and
[OSX](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-mac-os-x/index.html) are also found in the [CUDA Toolkit Documentation Page](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html).

Practically, we urge students to install CUDA libraries prior to install any deep learning specific tools.
To install them, please refer to:

- [CUDA installation page](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4RK3pacJh)
- [CUDNN torch bindings](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch)

#### Torch installation
    
Please refer to the official torch webpage: [here](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) 

For Windows users, please refer to [Running Torch on Windows](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Windows#using-a-virtual-machine).
#### GIT basic usage

For instance, in order to obtain the kit on a laptop or workstation, and further access assignment 1:
```
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:junbo_jake_zhao/deeplearningkit.git
    cd a1
```
